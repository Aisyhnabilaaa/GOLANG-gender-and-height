# Ideal Body Weight Calculator

This Go program calculates the ideal body weight based on gender and height using a basic formula. It allows users to input their gender (male/female) and height, and outputs the calculated ideal weight.

## Features
- Accepts user input for gender (`laki laki` for male, `perempuan` for female) and height in centimeters.
- Calculates ideal body weight using the following formulas:
  - For males: `Ideal Weight = (height - 100) - 10%`
  - For females: `Ideal Weight = (height - 100) - 15%`
